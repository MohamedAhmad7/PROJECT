1. Project Description 
What are we building? 
We are developing SmartTask Manager, a Java based task management application with a 
Graphical User Interface (GUI). The application will help users organize their daily tasks 
efficiently by allowing them to add, delete, and update tasks with due dates, priority levels, 
and categories. 
Why are we building it? 
Task management is crucial for students, professionals, and individuals managing 
multiple responsibilities. Many existing task management apps are either too complex or 
lack essential features such as priority sorting and notifications. This project aims to 
create a simple, efficient, and user friendly task manager.
